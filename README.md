## Abstract

This study examines public sentiment towards the UN COP27 Climate Change Conference and the establishment of a loss and damage fund using sentiment analysis of Twitter data. Our analysis reveals that the overall sentiment towards COP27 was positive, with a few exceptions on specific dates, such as November 7th and November 20th, potentially due to concerns about the conference's outcomes and effectiveness. In contrast, tweets related to the loss and damage fund consistently exhibited negative sentiment scores, indicating public skepticism about the fund's long-term success. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for future climate policy and communication strategies, emphasizing the need for transparency, accountability, clear communication, addressing public concerns, highlighting successes, fostering public engagement, collaborating with influencers, and focusing on solutions. Implementing these recommendations can help foster positive public sentiment, drive engagement, and create a supportive environment for effective climate action.
