## Abstract

This paper examines the public sentiment towards the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) held in Egypt in November 2022 and the newly established loss and damage fund. Using sentiment analysis on a collection of relevant tweets, we aim to understand the public's attitude towards the conference's outcomes and the perceived effectiveness of the fund in addressing climate change. Our sentiment analysis of tweets connected to the UN COP27 meetings and the loss and damage fund has provided valuable insights into public sentiment towards these topics. While the overall sentiment towards COP27 was positive, specific dates such as November 7th and November 20th had notably lower sentiment scores, potentially due to concerns about the conference's outcomes and effectiveness. Additionally, the consistently negative sentiment scores for tweets related to the loss and damage fund indicate that people are skeptical about the fund's long-term success. This finding underscores the need for policymakers, climate activists, and other stakeholders to address public concerns and improve communication about the fund's objectives and strategies.
