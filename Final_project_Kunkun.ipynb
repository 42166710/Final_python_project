    "This paper examines the public sentiment towards the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) held in Egypt in November 2022 and the newly established loss and damage fund. Using sentiment analysis on a collection of relevant tweets, we aim to understand the public's attitude towards the conference's outcomes and the perceived effectiveness of the fund in addressing climate change.\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change is an existential threat, and efforts to address this crisis have gained global attention in recent years. One such effort is the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) to be held in Egypt from November 6 to November 20, 2022. This conference brings together more than 200 countries to discuss strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change and support vulnerable countries. Given the great public interest in this event, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the public sentiment towards COP27 and the Loss and Damage Fund established during the conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary research question for this project is: What are the sentiments expressed by the public towards the UN COP27 meetings on Twitter? The secondary research question for this project is: How does the public perceive the loss and damage fund established during COP27, which aims to support poor nations suffering due to climate change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our assumption is that the sentiment expressed on Twitter about COP27 and the Fund will be predominantly positive due to the recognition of the importance of addressing climate change. However, we also acknowledge that there is a potential for criticism and negative sentiment due to the perceived inadequacy of the outcomes of the conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding public sentiment about the COP27 meeting and the Loss and Damage Fund is critical for a variety of reasons. First, it provides insight into the level of public engagement and awareness of climate change issues. Second, it allows stakeholders to gauge public attitudes toward international efforts to address climate change. Finally, it helps to inform future climate policy and communication strategies by identifying areas of public support or skepticism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss and damage fund is a significant outcome of COP27, as it signifies the acknowledgment of developed countries in the need to support developing nations suffering from climate change impacts. The fund has been hailed as a step towards justice by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and offers hope to vulnerable populations for recovery and rebuilding (Huq & Singh, 2022). However, the details of the fund's operation have been left to future discussions, potentially leading to uncertainty and mixed sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we will present the methodology and results of our sentiment analysis on tweets connected to the UN COP27 meetings and the loss and damage fund. We will discuss the implications of the findings and offer recommendations for future climate policy and communication strategies.\n"

    "To collect Twitter data for this project, we utilized the Twitter API and the twarc2 library, a command line tool and Python library designed for archiving Twitter data. We targeted tweets that included the following hashtags: #COP27, #Climatechange, #Climateaction, and #energy. Additionally, we searched for tweets containing the keywords: COP27, Climate action, Climate change, energy, and loss and damage fund. Our data collection was divided into three stages:\n",

    "Finally, we created a line plot to visualize the mean sentiment scores of the tweets over time, specifically by day. This was achieved using the pandas 'resample' method, which allowed us to calculate the mean sentiment score for each day during the data collection period. The resulting plot provides insights into how the public sentiment towards COP27 and the loss and damage fund evolved throughout the conference and its aftermath.\n",

    "By employing this code, we effectively processed, analyzed, and visualized the sentiment of tweets related to the COP27 meetings and the loss and damage fund. This enabled us to draw conclusions about public sentiment towards these topics and identify potential areas for future research and policy development."

Then, we used Excel to filter tweets containing the keyword \"loss and damage fund\" and conducted a separate sentiment analysis on this subset of tweets. This approach enabled us to compare the general sentiment towards COP27 with the specific sentiment related to the loss and damage fund. Next is the analysis for the Loss and Damage Fund, because the steps are consistent, we will not repeat the explanation."

I put the code that didn't work here as well."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analysis of tweets related to COP27 and the loss and damage fund revealed several interesting insights. In general, the daily sentiment scores for tweets about COP27 were positive, indicating that the public had an overall favorable response to the conference. However, two specific dates – November 7th and November 20th – had notably lower sentiment scores of 0.13 and 0.15, respectively, compared to other dates with scores above 0.22.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low sentiment score on November 20th, the last day of the conference, may be attributed to concerns about the lack of tangible outcomes from COP27. As the conference drew to a close, people may have expressed disappointment or anxiety about the effectiveness of the event and the actions agreed upon by the participating countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low sentiment score on November 20th, the final day of COP27, could be further attributed to several factors. Firstly, the public may have been frustrated by the perceived lack of ambitious commitments by the participating countries, especially in light of the urgency of the climate crisis. Secondly, the conference may have concluded without addressing some key concerns, such as concrete measures for emissions reductions, adaptation finance, and technology transfer. Lastly, the media coverage on the final day might have been critical, highlighting the gaps between the conference's stated goals and its actual outcomes, leading to a negative public sentiment on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low sentiment score on November 7th, the second day of the conference, could be due to several reasons. Some possible explanations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial skepticism: People may have been skeptical about the potential for meaningful progress at the beginning of the conference, given past experiences with climate negotiations.\n",
    "\n",
    "High expectations: The public may have had high expectations for COP27, and as the conference commenced, they may have been disappointed by the perceived slow pace or lack of immediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controversial news or events: Specific incidents or discussions taking place during the conference on November 7th may have led to negative reactions from the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, our analysis of tweets specifically related to the loss and damage fund revealed that the daily sentiment scores were negative, suggesting that people were generally pessimistic about the long-term effectiveness of the fund. This finding is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights a discrepancy between the overall positive sentiment towards COP27 and the negative sentiment towards the loss and damage fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the sentiment analysis conducted, we can offer the following recommendations for future climate policy and communication strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transparency and accountability: Ensure that climate policies and commitments are transparent, measurable, and verifiable. Regular progress reports and updates should be made available to the public, fostering a sense of accountability among participating countries.\n",
    "2. Clear communication: Simplify complex climate policies and terms to make them more accessible and understandable to the general public. Use various communication channels, such as social media, websites, and infographics, to disseminate information effectively.\n",
    "3. Address public concerns: Identify and address public concerns and skepticism regarding climate policies, such as the loss and damage fund. Engage in open dialogues and discussions with the public to build trust and understanding.\n",
    "4. Highlight successes: Share success stories and best practices from climate initiatives, showcasing tangible results and inspiring positive sentiments among the public.\n",
    "5. Foster public engagement: Encourage public participation in climate-related discussions and decision-making processes. This could include hosting town hall meetings, surveys, or online forums where people can voice their opinions and concerns.\n",
    "6. Collaborate with influencers and thought leaders: Partner with influencers, celebrities, and thought leaders to amplify climate messages and engage a wider audience. Their endorsement can help create a positive sentiment towards climate policies and actions.\n",
    "7. Targeted messaging: Develop tailored communication strategies for different segments of the population. Address the unique concerns and interests of various groups, such as youth, business owners, and local communities, to foster a sense of inclusiveness and ownership.\n",
    "8. Focus on solutions: Emphasize the solutions and opportunities provided by climate policies, such as green jobs, sustainable development, and improved quality of life. This can help generate optimism and support for climate initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these recommendations, policymakers and communicators can foster positive public sentiment towards climate policies, drive engagement, and ultimately, create a supportive environment for effective climate action.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sentiment analysis of tweets connected to the UN COP27 meetings and the loss and damage fund has provided valuable insights into public sentiment towards these topics. While the overall sentiment towards COP27 was positive, specific dates such as November 7th and November 20th had notably lower sentiment scores, potentially due to concerns about the conference's outcomes and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the consistently negative sentiment scores for tweets related to the loss and damage fund indicate that people are skeptical about the fund's long-term success. This finding underscores the need for policymakers, climate activists, and other stakeholders to address public concerns and improve communication about the fund's objectives and strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, sentiment analysis of tweets connected to climate change events, such as COP27, can provide crucial insights into public opinion and engagement. These insights can inform future climate policies, communication strategies, and actions to ensure that public concerns are addressed, and global efforts to tackle climate change are effective and well-supported.\n"
